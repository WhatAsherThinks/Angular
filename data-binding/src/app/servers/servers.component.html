<!-- with square brackets you are directly binding to native html property (disabled). You bind it to an expression.
Has to be typescript code within the quotes
For this we bind it to something that results to a boolean

Can also bind to Directives and custom components-->
<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer" >Add Server</button>
<p [innerText]="allowNewServer"></p>
<!-- An example of string interpolation of a boolean -->
<p>{{ allowNewServer }}</p>
<app-server></app-server>
<app-server></app-server>
