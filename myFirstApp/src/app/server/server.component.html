<!-- String interpolation: use double curly braces {{ }} and write TypeScript expression. Easiest is property reference
can also write any expression that will be turned into a string at the end, has to somehow return a string.
can't be multiline/block expression
ex: {{ 'server' }}
Works with a number (ServerId), because it can be converted to a string. -->
<p>{{'Server'}} with ID {{serverId}} is {{ getServerStatus() }}</p>
